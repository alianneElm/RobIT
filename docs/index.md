# RobIT — The Robot That Does What It's Told (Mostly)

Welcome to **RobIT**, a command-line robot simulator built in Python.  
RobIT moves inside a grid world you define, obeying directional commands like a loyal assistant.

---

## What is RobIT?

RobIT lives in a grid-based environment. You place it at a valid starting position and give it commands:

- `L`: Turn left
- `R`: Turn right
- `F`: Move forward
- `B`: Move backward

RobIT won't let itself fall off the grid — it alerts you and exits safely.
