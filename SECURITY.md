## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability or any behavior that might pose a risk, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not open a public issue.**
2. Instead, contact us **privately** via email: `alianneelm@yahoo.se`
3. Include as many details as possible:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Affected component (if known)
   - Severity assessment
   - Screenshots or logs if applicable

---

## Security Best Practices

Although RobIT is a CLI-only educational tool, it follows these practices:

- No network access or external inputs
- No file I/O or persistence by default
- Code is fully test-covered and linted
- All logic runs within sandboxed input prompts

---

## Disclosure Timeline

We will publicly disclose and patch critical issues in the next tagged release once verified and resolved.

Thank you for helping make open-source software better and safer!
